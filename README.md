# Object-Detection-Marker-Tracker

This project is a scientific study on "writing behaviours" of french and canadian children! 
In other words, tracking the mouvement of upper body while writing. 

In order to analyze the movement, the children are wearing special clothes with markers on them (as shown in the video below). These markers alows us to track down the movement of each body part separately (head, shoulders, elbows, wrists). 

The main tool used in this project is opencv. 

With the Gui, you can choose your file, select which markers are to be tracked down and plot the movements. The Gui also alows us to select the ROI (region of interest).
